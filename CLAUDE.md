# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **personal portfolio and educational blog website** hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as both a professional resume site and a technical knowledge repository, with content focused on teaching programming concepts concisely.

**Tech Stack**: Jekyll 3.9.2 + GitHub Pages
**Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Pages on push to main
**Website URL**: https://danieltellier.github.io

## Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run local development server with live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve
# View at http://localhost:4000/

# Build static site (output to _site/)
bundle exec jekyll build
```

### Resume Compilation
```bash
# Compile LaTeX resume to PDF
./docs/resumes/make-resume.sh
# Input: docs/resumes/main/daniel_tellier.tex
# Output: docs/resumes/main/daniel_tellier.pdf
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production (auto-builds on GitHub Pages)
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
```

## Architecture

### Static Site Generation Pattern
Jekyll converts markdown content into static HTML. The flow is:
```
Markdown files → Jekyll build → Static HTML → GitHub Pages CDN
```

**Key characteristics**:
- All content pre-generated (zero runtime overhead)
- GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys on push to main
- No backend, databases, or server-side processing
- Resume is separately compiled from LaTeX to PDF

### Tech Stack
- **Jekyll 3.9.2**: Static site generator (Ruby)
- **jekyll-theme-primer**: GitHub's minimalist theme
- **kramdown + GFM**: Markdown parser with GitHub Flavored Markdown
- **pdflatex**: LaTeX compiler for resume

## Content Patterns

### Post Structure (posts/template.md)
All posts follow this structure:
```markdown
# Title

## Objective
Brief description of what the post teaches.

## Table of Contents
- [Section 1](#section-1)
- [Section 2](#section-2)

## [Content Sections]
...
```

### Post Categories
Posts are organized in `index.md` under these categories:
- **CUDA** - High-performance computing
- **Productivity** - Learning methodologies and tooling
- **Neovim** - Advanced editor configuration
- **Vim** - Core editor concepts

### Creating New Posts
1. Create new `.md` file in `posts/` directory (lowercase, hyphens)
2. Follow structure from `posts/template.md`
3. Add link to `index.md` under appropriate category
4. Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Commit and push to deploy

### Markdown Constraints
**IMPORTANT** (from README.md):
- Code blocks cannot be placed directly under bullet points
- A blank line is required between bullets and code blocks

```markdown
# WRONG
- Point 1
```code```

# CORRECT
- Point 1

```code```
```

## Key Conventions

### Minimal Configuration
- `_config.yml` is intentionally minimal (~9 lines)
- No YAML front matter needed in posts
- Content-first approach

### Manual Navigation
- Navigation is manually curated in `index.md` (not auto-generated)
- Posts are standalone and self-contained
- Each post linked explicitly from homepage

### Dual Content Model
- **Blog posts**: Educational technical content in `posts/`
- **Professional resume**: LaTeX source → PDF in `docs/resumes/`
- **Reference materials**: PDFs and images in `docs/` and `images/`

### Build Artifacts
- Jekyll output (`_site/`) is never committed (auto-generated by GitHub)
- Resume PDF is committed (manually compiled from LaTeX)
- LaTeX build artifacts (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`) are gitignored
