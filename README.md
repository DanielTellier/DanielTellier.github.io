# Intro
Hi I am Daniel Tellier and this is my personal website.

# Important
A code block with three backticks will break if directly placed under \
a bullet point. There needs to be a new line between the bullet and the \
code block. Also best to put a new line after the matching three backticks.

# Setup
- Run local website and view in firefox in new tab:

```shell
bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve
firefox --new-tab --url http://localhost:4000/
```

- You can edit and save files locally and refresh the local page in firefox \
  to immediately see your changes.
- Once you are satisfied with your local changes you can commit and push \
  to see your changes on your actual GitHub hosted website.
